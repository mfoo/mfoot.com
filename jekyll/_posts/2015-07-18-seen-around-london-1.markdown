Last week I started to play Google's augmented reality game [Ingress](http://ingress.com/). It's a sneaky way of helping
people experience the sights of their city while promoting getting people up off of their chairs to walk around and get
some exercise. Despite not being very involved in the game yet - I have been playing solo so far - the Ingress app tells
me I've visited 222 unique portals. I'm guessing that at least a hundred of those are historic or cultural places that
I'd never noticed or payed attention to before. I've cycled many kilometres in order to hack portals and gain ammunition
for attacking larger targets.

As I've been visiting new places and finding new things I've started taking photos of stuff I see that interests
me. Many of these things are things that I pass by regularly and haven't noticed before. Maybe these photos will help
somebody else to notice things around them and be pleasantly surprised.
