I recently had the chance to go to a light painting workshop that was hosted by
the [London Photographic Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/londonphotos/).
They have constructed their own tools and take groups of around 10 people to
come and do some light painting.

While cold, it was surprisingly fun. There's no real requirement except a
tripod, but a cable shutter release helps. There's no required knowledge
either, so anybody can come and enjoy themselves.

Here are some examples of the kinds of things they can do:
