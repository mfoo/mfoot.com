I grew up with stories of weird and wonderful wines and beers that my mum had made - stuff exploding and clothes stained
purple from picking wild hedgerow blackberries for wine making. It sounded like fun so recently I decided to try it
myself. Since then I've made somewhere in the region of 6-8 batches each of beers and wines and I can confirm that it's
both fun and satisfying. It doesn't require a whole lot of kit, it doesn't take long, and it saves you money compared to
buying from the shops.
</p>

<p>
If you're interested in getting into homebrew and don't know what equipment you'll need or how complicated it is, this
post is for you. It's worth noting that I haven't tried cider yet but it's on my to do list. I expect a lot of what I'm
saying here also applies to cider making but I can't be certain until I've tried it.

For beers and wines brewing is easy enough that anybody with access to clean water can do it with a small amount of
equipment. You'll require some
</p>

<p>
It doesn't even take up much space - initial preparation takes a bit of counter space but fermentation requires no more
space than an available chair or chair-sized gap. Furthermore, the setup cost is not expensive. You can get a pretty
decent beer from simple beer kits, but with all hobbies there are more complex, more expensive options available that
offer more control.
</p>

<p>
So, what do you need? This depends somewhat on what you're making and how much of it you want. For beers the basic
equipment is all based on 25 litre (~40 pints) batches, but for wine the usual size is a 3 litre demijohn - a small
glass container. Whether you're making beer, cider, or wine, they all share the following common components:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some flavoured liquid containing either natural or added sugar that you can ferment</li>
<li>A container to ferment the liquid in</li>
<li>Some yeast</li>
<li>A bung and airlock to make the container airtight</li>
<li>A big plastic spoon</li>
<li>A sanitiser, usually a powdered chemical that you mix with water</li>
<li>A thermometer, preferably glass, that you can dip into liquid that covers the 15 to 100c range</li>
<li>A siphon (the most basic DIY version is just a piece of tubing)</li>
<li>A plastic water jug. 2L kitchen jugs work fine</li>
<li>A room with a fairly constant appropriate temperature</li>
<li>Something to put your drink in when it's done. If you're using bottles for beer you'll need a capping tool and some
caps also. If you're making wine you can buy reusable stoppers</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition there's some optional stuff:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A hydrometer and jar, used for existing your alcohol content / ABV</li>
<li>One of those stick-on fish tank thermometers to attach to your fermenter for convenient at-a-glance information</li>
</ul>

<p>
For beer you can buy a homebrew starter kit, which is usually a good way of getting everything in the above list without
much effort. The kits don't seem to be readily available for wine, so you'll want to order the parts separately. It's
cheaper than beer as you need less stuff. <a href="http://www.wilko.com/homebrew-accessories+equipment/wilko-demijohn-container-glass-45l/invt/0022556">Wilco sell demijohns</a> for £7. Homebrew is still a popular pass time and you
shouldn't have trouble finding an online shop that has what you need, but fewer and fewer shops exist on high streets
these days. I've bought stuff from both eBay and <a href="http://the-home-brew-shop.co.uk/">The Home Brew Shop</a> without any problems.

<p>
This is a picture of a typical fully featured starter kit for beer - it's Brewferm's "deluxe starter kit".
</p>

<p>
Once you've got your equipment (if your starter kit doesn't contain one) you'll need a beer/wine kit. Something like
<a href="http://www.wilko.com/icat/homebrewbeer">this</a> for beer, or <a href="http://www.wilko.com/icat/homebrewwine">this</a> for wine. Each time you want a new batch you'll need to order a new kit but all the equipment can
be re-used. You should note that these kits usually don't contain sugar, but the instructions will tell you if you need
to buy some or not. These kits are the most basic ways of making beer and the majority of my beers have been made with
them. There are many different kits around so you can try for many different kinds of beers. I've been particularly
impressed with <a href="http://www.wilko.com/cider+beer-brewing/wilko-dark-velvet-stout/invt/0318379">this one</a>. Once you want to try something more advanced you can do what I've done and start a foray into
the world of <a href="https://byo.com/newbrew/all-grain">all grain brewing</a> which requires more investment into kit but gives even more control.

<h2 id="orgheadline2">The cost of beer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
With a beer kit such as the porter linked above you can get almost 40 pints out of it, for £10 (plus ~£1 of sugar),
leading to somewhere in the region of £0.30 a pint. Comparing that to the £2-£3 you'd pay from the supermarket, that's a
huge reduction.
</p>

<p>
For wine a <a href="http://www.wilko.com/wine-homebrew-kits/wilko-cabernet-sauvignon-6-bottles/invt/0022741">typical kit</a> for 6 bottles costs around £10 also, bringing it to about £1.70 a bottle. I recently made 25
litres of beetroot wine in one of my beer fermenters. I went to the local market and bought a few kg of beetroot for £5,
then added about £1 of sugar and £0.50 of yeast and I can get about 30 bottles of wine from it - bringing the per-bottle
cost down to ~£0.22.

Basic process, examples that I've made.

<p>
Tasting beer and wine that you've brewed yourself gives great satisfaction, especially when you have enough to share
with friends. It's a fairly simple process and you'll go from zero to beer in three weeks or zero to wine in a couple of
months. The initial effort is a couple of hours and then it's just a waiting game.

<h2 id="orgheadline3">Books and resources</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
There's a huge amount of information available on homebrew. For beer the book How to Brew by John Palmer is great and
the first edition is <a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/">available online free</a>. YouTube is a great resource, as is eBay as a lot of the information on
homebrewing hasn't changed much since the 70s/80s. I always keep an eye out in charity shops for homebrew books and to
date I've found the best one to be <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Brewing-Beers-Those-Amateur-Winemaker/dp/1854861255">Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy</a> because it includes a whole bunch of recipes (but
doesn't cover some of the basics that How To Brew does). For wine, C.J.J. Berry's <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/First-Steps-Winemaking-C-Berry/dp/1854861395/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463236050&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=first+steps+in+winemaking">First Steps in Winemaking</a> is a kind of
bible and has loads of recipes and great information - I would recommend his rice and raisin wine recipe. There are also
many online forums and the <a href="http://homebrew.stackexchange.com/">Homebrewing Stack Exchange</a> for getting prompt replies to questions.
