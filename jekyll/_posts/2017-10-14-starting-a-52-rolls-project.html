I've just committed myself to a 52 rolls project. This means that I'm going to try and shoot at least one roll of film
every week for an entire year. A "roll" could be a roll of 35mm, a roll of 120 film, a pack of instant film, or a few
shots sheet film. The aim is to force me to go out and take photographs and explore new areas. In doing so I hope to
learn new things, practice my skills and hopefully grow creatively as well as technically. What really matters is that
I'm out there doing something I love to do and didn't really make enough time for myself to do previously. By starting a
project I'm giving myself a reason, and by admitting it here I've given myself somebody to hold me accountable.

I plan to be posting photos from each week online on this blog. The shot below comes from my first roll - Ilford Delta
400 @ box speed. It was shot one evening after work by the side of St Paul's Cathedral in London on a Leica M6 TTL with
a Summicron-M 35mm ASPH.

I'll try to post each week and I'll try to keep this post updated with links, but I might be a little inconsistent on
timing since it takes time to develop and scan the negatives.
