I recently purchased a second hand Mamiya RZ67 Pro II, an incredibly large
medium format studio camera. It's heavy to carry around uncomfortable to put
on a messenger style bag, so I need to use a backpack. It fills the entire
camera body + lens section of the Lowepro Orion Trekker II bag I got given.
Despite being cumbersome, the RZ67 is a pleasure to use. It has so many safety
features to stop you making mistakes, and I've never had a camera that lets you
change film mid-way through a roll before. There are several very explicit
manual steps to take before any photograph can be produced that slow you down
and make you consider every detail of your shot. I'm still getting used to it,
but I took it to Belgium with me and really enjoyed it, and a few nights ago I
walked around London after dark to see some of the attractions in a different
light. I got several odd looks with a sturdy tripod and the RZ67 attached and a
few comments about the camera being huge. One guy walked past and asked "why
don't you just buy an iPhone?".

Here are some of the shots. They are either f/8 or f/16 @ 60 seconds on Kodak
Ektar. This is easy because the RZ67's bulb mode automatically cuts out at 60
seconds so I didn't need to count seconds in my head.
