<p>
I've been using org mode with emacs more and more recently. It's exceptional. I keep finding new features and
capabilities that make the switch to emacs increasingly worthwhile. This post is about configuring emacs and managing
configuration in an approachable, coherent, and understandable way.

From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Wikipedia article for Literate programming</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Literate programming is an approach to programming introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an
explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and
traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The core concept is that a program is much easier to understand by any human being when it is mixed with prose about
that program. While often algorithmic or structural comments in code are quite detailed, I often find single line
comments without much meaning that do little to help me understand the code. Complex systems require complex
descriptions, and taking the time to properly annotate code is important. It's often quite difficult as well, as it's
combined with a choice of where exactly to put the comment so that it's most useful - is there any documentation to
update as well?

I only started using emacs recently. Every few days I changed a configuration setting to get the editor to do what I
wanted or to be more like the in-my-opinion superior vim defaults. I added and configured plugins, wrote functions that
got executed on certain language-specific programming mode hooks, changed line length and word wrapping settings,
configured themes and highlighting, etc.
</p>

<p>
I ended up with a <code>.emacs</code> file that was huge and when I came back to modify it I didn't always remember the reason behind
each setting. What effect does it have? What is wrong with the default setting? The comments I had made tended to
explain what the line was doing but not why. A lot of lines didn't have comments at all. Here's an extract from my
<code>.emacs</code> file from <a href="https://github.com/mfoo/dotfiles/blob/66a4b4a41e42e7c4c58e88c8718ea27febb59964/.emacshttps://github.com/mfoo/dotfiles/blob/66a4b4a41e42e7c4c58e88c8718ea27febb59964/.emacs">a recent commit</a>:

<p>
What's wrong here? Well, the comment indentation changes a lot, there's similar types of settings in different parts of
the file, there's global variables very close to language specific variables, and a lot of the non-obvious settings
aren't commented at all. There's also a global mode being enabled inside a section of the configuration that looks like
it's meant for editor defaults configuration. What a mess.
</p>

<p>
This doesn't just happen in emacs config. Here's a snippet from my old <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfoo/dotfiles/master/.vimrc">.vimrc</a>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-vimrc">set autoindent      " Copy indent from current line when starting a new line
					" (typing &lt;CR&gt; in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O"

set smartindent     " Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line. Works
					" for C-like programs, but can also be used for other
					" languages.

Here I've tried to keep the comments consistent but there's still settings, keybindings, and custom functions all in
similar places. I've tried to keep the file separated by headers but they are only as good as the diligence I use when
maintaining the file. It's obvious that I've worked on these files bit by bit over time without spending much effort on
making it understandable or organising the sections. This is entirely my fault, but I don't feel like the standard style
of configuration files provides a framework to encourage people to do the right thing. They often end up as a jumbled
bucket of unrelated settings. A maintenance quagmire. It feels like a laziness epidemic. The only cure is diligence when
making changes.
</p>

<p>
Often going back and adding comments after-the-fact is difficult if you don't remember why the setting existed in the
first place or what the defaults were. Given that I was just at the beginning of my emacs adventure and had made a
relatively small number of changes I was at an ideal place to apply a framework that would encourage documentation and
do it right from the start.

Enter org-mode. Org is a system for writing plain text notes with syntax highlighting, code execution, task scheduling,
agenda management, and many more. The whole idea is that you can write notes and mix them with references to things like
articles, images, and example code combined with the output of that code after it is executed. For instance, imagine I'm
taking notes on a support request that needs some database diving and I need to construct a query. I can make a SQL code
block, tell org mode to use my local development database, then execute it. The results are shown in a table right under
the SQL statement. Without ever leaving emacs. I can refine the query until I have exactly what I want before running it
on the production database. In addition to the ability to execute pretty much arbitrary code right from inside emacs,
org comes with a very interesting function called <code>org-babel-load-file</code>. Using <code>M-x describe-function &lt;ret&gt;
org-babel-load-file</code> we can see what it does:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
org-babel-load-file is an interactive compiled Lisp function.
</p>

<p>
(org-babel-load-file FILE &amp;optional COMPILE)
</p>

<p>
Load Emacs Lisp source code blocks in the Org-mode FILE.
This function exports the source code using `org-babel-tangle'
and then loads the resulting file using `load-file'.  With prefix
arg (noninteractively: 2nd arg) COMPILE the tangled Emacs Lisp
file to byte-code before it is loaded.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In short it executes any code inside emacs-lisp source code blocks in an org mode file. This is awesome. It means we can
write a file in org format giving descriptions and code examples and have emacs load the file, completely ignore the
comments, and evaluate the emacs-lisp source blocks within it. Take a look at my <code>~/.emacs</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

</pre>
</div>

<p>
That's it. Now we take a look at a snippet from <code>~/.emacs.d/config.org</code>:
</p>

<pre class="example">
* Startup message
Don't show the default emacs startup message when it's opened

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
#+END_SRC

Let's also show a fortune message in the scratch buffer when we start emacs:

[[https://github.com/andschwa/fortune-cookie][Source here]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package fortune-cookie
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq fortune-cookie-cowsay-enable nil) ; Disable cowsay
  (fortune-cookie-mode)                   ; Enable fortune cookie mode
)
#+END_SRC
</pre>

This is leagues ahead of any other way of representing and grouping configuration I have ever seen. You can make full
use of org mode's tagging, section folding, task tracking and organisational features right from inside your
configuration file. You can include state diagrams, tables, sample inputs and outputs for functions. There's human
readable descriptions behind what each line is doing. There's a link to the original project page for the mode I'm
adding. I can schedule work on sections of the configuration that I don't have time to change right now and it will
appear on my global agenda along with any other tasks I'm managing with org mode.
</p>

<p>
And it gets better. Org mode has a built in exporting system for a whole bunch of different export formats. I can export
my configuration file to HTML and it will add the appropriate menu structure and source code highlighting. All of the
links stored in my org mode files become hyperlinks to documentation or project websites. It makes it incredibly easy to
share configuration files so that the readers, too, can understand why I've changed each setting. If you're not
convinced with how powerful this is yet, <a href="https://www.mfoot.com/static/emacs-config/config.html">Here's a link to the generated config</a>. And <a href="https://www.mfoot.com/static/emacs-config/config.org">here's a link to the raw
configuration file</a> I'd wager that even a non-emacs user can understand some of what's going on. You don't even need to
look at the setting, just read the description. Literate programming's most important feature for me is the fact that at
some point in the future I'm going to need to remember why I changed something, and I feel like this is the ideal format
to help me with that. Nothing else I've seen comes close. My documentation for my configuration file <i>is</i> my configuration
file. Executable documentation.
</p>

<p>
The concepts of literate programming are unrelated to org mode, org is just an enabler. Not everybody uses emacs, but if
you've managed to get this far as a non-emacs user, I hope you've at least learned something about the value of the
literate programming concept.
</p>

<p>
And maybe if you've soaked up even some of the enthusiasm I have for org-mode, you might like to give it a try too!
