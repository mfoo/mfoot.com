![The Salt and Silver exhibition at the Tate
Britain](http://images.tate.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/grid-normal-16-cols/public/images/saltsilver_0.jpg?itok=nB5ouNT5)

There is currently an excellent exhibition at the Tate Britain in London called [Salt and
Silver](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/salt-and-silver-early-photography-1840-1860)
that I would recommend to anybody with an interest in the early history of photography. The
exhibition is about the history of the [salt print process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_print)
discovered and refined by [William Henry Fox
Talbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fox_Talbot) in the 1800s. It contains a selection of
prints from early photographers showing how printing techniques became more popular and improved. I
took some notes at the exhibition for some follow-up research and one of the referenced texts was a
book that was published by Talbot himself called [The Pencil of
Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pencil_of_Nature). It was published in six installments
between 1844 and 1846 and is an account of his path and motivations during his discovery and
cultivation of the calotype printing process. It's [available for free on Project
Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33447) and it's not very long so it's easy to install
on a Kindle or mobile device and read on the way to work.

Talbot was a British inventor born in 1800 who made major contributions to the development of
photography as an art. In The Pencil of Nature he describes how he came to think about the
possibility of a photographic reproduction. In October 1833 Talbot visited Lake Como in Italy. As
anybody on holiday in modern times might, he wanted to record what he saw in this beautiful
location. The best available tools at the time were artistic sketches made by eye or using a [Camera
Lucida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lucida) as a drawing aid. Sketches and paintings were
often not very scientific and required a degree of skill and artistry for a faithful reproduction
of the scene. The Camera Lucida projected the image onto the paper in a form of double exposure,
which meant that observers could simply trace the important lines of geometry in the scene and
achieve a good likeness of perspective and size. Talbot used the camera lucida to make the sketch
shown here (I'm not inlining it as I haven't asked for permission):

In the book he describes his extreme disappointment with the result:

> For when the eye was removed from the prism -- in which all looked beautiful -- I found that the
> faithless pencil had only left traces on the paper melancholy to behold.
>
> -- <cite>William Henry Fox Talbot, The Pencil of Nature</cite>

Talbot spent time pondering whether or not he could improve the process by making it automatic,
removing the low fidelity human element from the image recording process. He knew that certain
chemical salts were sensitive to light. He made some experiments mixing silver nitrate and sodium
chloride to produce silver chloride (neither ingredient is light sensitive on its own, and silver
nitrate is good at displacing other metals from salts, so it's simple to produce the light
sensitive combination), silver iodide, and silver bromide and then using them for print making. He
varied the relative quantity of silver nitrate and salt and by 1834 had found a way of producing a
photographic [contact print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_print) that was satisfactory. He
discovered that a high quantity of salt in the original mixing process would thoroughly arrest
development, so subsequently he used a salt solution as a fixing wash to ensure that no further
development occurred after the initial exposure.

> This process, of the formation of a subchloride by the use of a very weak solution of salt,
> having been discovered in the spring of 1834, no difficulty was found in obtaining distinct and
> very pleasing images of such things as leaves, lace, and other flat objects of complicated forms
> and outlines, by exposing them to the light of the sun.
>
> The paper being well dried, the leaves, etc. were spread upon it, and covered with a glass
> pressed down tightly, and then placed in the sunshine; and when the paper grew dark, the whole was
> carried into the shade, and the objects being removed from off the paper, were found to have left
> their images very perfectly and beautifully impressed or delineated upon it.

When used as the photographic medium with a camera obscura however, the result was unsatisfactory
and took a very long time -- too long to make it feasible and comparable to sketches. After a long
exposure time (he quoted two hours for one exposure) the outlines of buildings and trees could be
seen but the details in foliage and brickwork could not.

The next improvement to the process came through the application of multiple coats of alternating
silver and salt. He would coat the silver, let the paper dry, coat the salt, and then repeat the
process a few times. He also found that by using the paper inside the camera when it was still wet
he could reduce the exposure time with a camera obscura to around 10 minutes. The next problem was
that the prints were very small as the paper had to fit inside the camera and that the preparation
took a long time before a piece of paper could be exposed.

In 1839 [Louis Daguerre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Daguerre) published his independent
findings in the practice of photographic image making before Talbot had published anything.
Daguerre's announcement of the [Daguerrotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype) process
did not initially describe how it worked, but simply stated that it was possible. Talbot notes that
he had been considering collating his notes and writings and publishing them to the Royal Society
at the end of 1838, but he got sidetracked with chronicling another scientific observation that he
had made whereby he could produce products of different colours by exposing thin leafs of silver
with drops of iodide on them through colourer filters.

> [...] a most unexpected phenomenon occurred when the silver plate was brought into the light by
> placing it near a window. For then the coloured rings shortly began to change their colours, and
> assumed other and quite unusual tints, such as are never seen in the “colours of thin plates.”
> For instance, the part of the silver plate which at first shone with a pale yellow colour, was
> changed to a dark olive green when brought into the daylight.

Talbot remarked that the discoveries by Daguerre were remarkable but was upset that he was unable
to announce the discovery of the photographic art to the world.

> Such was the progress which I had made in this inquiry at the close of the year 1838, when an
> event occurred in the scientific world, which in some degree frustrated the hope with which I had
> pursued, during nearly five years, this long and complicated, but interesting series of
> experiments—the hope, namely, of being the first to announce to the world the existence of the
> New Art—which has been since named Photography.

Having heard Daguerre's announcement, Talbot began to refine his process. He shortened his exposure
times and developed salt printing as a way of converting his paper negatives to a positive --
producing the first negative-positive process. The paper would be coated with wax to improve its
transparency and then contact printed. Daguerrotypes were superior to Talbot's calotypes in several
ways. They had a greater tonal range and preserved much more detail but it was impossible to
reproduce the images. Each Daguerrotype is a one of a kind. If you see one, that piece of metal was
actually inside the camera when the picture was taken. In contrast, Calotype negatives made it easy
to produce multiple copies although the quality was influenced by the size of the fibers in the
original paper negative. Talbot announced his method in 1841 and but decided to patent it. Daguerre
on the other hand made his method available without restriction as a gift to the world. This
patenting is seen as a mistake by many people as it slowed growth in the calotype's uptake and
it caused an additional cost for users.

![Plate III. Articles Of China](/images/2015/05/24/plate_03.jpg)

In The Pencil of Nature, Talbot provides several images showing the properties of his technique and
suggests certain uses. In an image entitled 'Plate III. Articles Of China' (above) he suggests
(in a tone that suggests humour to me) that these prints could be used as proof of ownership of
items in a court case against a thief:

> And should a thief afterwards purloin the treasures—if the mute testimony of the picture were to
> be produced against him in court—it would certainly be evidence of a novel kind; but what the
> judge and jury might say to it, is a matter which I leave to the speculation of those who
> possess legal acumen.

In 'Plate IV. Articles Of Glass', Talbot describes his finding that the sensitivity of the paper
negative varies depending on the colour of the light it is receiving. He notes that blue hues
affect the paper almost as rapidly as white hues, but "on the contrary, green hues act very
feebly".

![Plate IV. Articles of Glass](/images/2015/05/24/plate_04.jpg)

Talbot also describes what might be the earliest description of using a photographic reflector to
enhance the available light and reduce shadow contrast when taking a picture.

> [...] it is a good plan to hold a white cloth on one side of the statue at a little distance to
> reflect back the sun's rays and cause a faint illumination of the parts which would otherwise be
> lost in shadow

He also notes that hen light is split by a prism and the image recorded on paper, the calotype
negative records exposure from parts of the spectrum beyond the visible red -- ultraviolet light.

There's an excellent description of how his negatives work as well:

> The ordinary effect of light upon white sensitive paper is to blacken it. If therefore any
> object, as a leaf for instance, be laid upon the paper, this, by intercepting the action of the
> light, preserves the whiteness of the paper beneath it, and accordingly when it is removed there
> appears the form or shadow of the leaf marked out in white upon the blackened paper; and since
> shadows are usually dark, and this is the reverse, it is called in the language of photography a
> negative image.

'Plate XX. Lace' is the first example he provides of such a negative:

![Plate XX. Lace](/images/2015/05/24//plate_20.jpg)

Each of the plates provided has a short description. My favourite is the photograph of Westminster
Abbey from plate XXII:

![Plate XXII. Westminster Abbey](/images/2015/05/24/plate_22.jpg)

Being a resident of London, I find the description quite funny:

> The stately edifices of the British Metropolis too frequently assume from the influence of our
> smoky atmosphere such a swarthy hue as wholly to obliterate the natural appearance of the stone
> of which they are constructed. This sooty covering destroys all harmony of colour, and leaves
> only the grandeur of form and proportions.

I thoroughly recommend that anybody interested in early photographic processes who is living
in or visiting London should visit the exhibition. I have several pages of notes on follow-up
research and discovering Talbot's book was just one of the excellent things about the collection.
