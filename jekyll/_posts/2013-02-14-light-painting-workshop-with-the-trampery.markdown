Yesterday I attended a light painting workshop that was hosted by The Trampery.
I had been wanting to get a chance to use my DIY light stick in anger and so I
spoke to the Trampery team and we organised a small light painting workshop for
residents at their amazing shared working offices in Shoreditch. The turn-up
wasn't as high as I was expecting but we had a great deal of fun, and a
smallish group meant that everybody could participate to the full. Below I've
included a few of the images that we made:
