I found this photo that I took a while ago and wanted to share it. It's a
double exposure on the Lomo LC-A+ camera using their Splitzer accessory on
Kodak Portra 400 film. The splitzer is a cool little accessory that allows you
to selectively cover up parts of the lens. Combined with a camera with multiple
exposure capability you can make some really cool images. This one is of the
entrance to the Greenwich Foot Tunnel near the Cutty Sark.

I love this kind of image and it's something I really want to develop in the
future. It seems quite unpredictable because you'll never be sure how they came
out!
