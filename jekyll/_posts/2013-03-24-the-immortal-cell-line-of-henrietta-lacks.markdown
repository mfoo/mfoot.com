[Henrietta Lacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks) was a poor
tobacco farmer from Virginia who was diagnosed with and subsequently died of
cervical cancer in 1951. During radiation treatment for her cancer at the John
Hopkins Hospital - one of the few hospitals at the time to treat African
American patients - a small part of the tumour was cut off and sent away for
testing without her permission (permission was not required at the time). Soon
after it was discovered that given the right conditions, the cancerous cells
would grow and divide outside the body. Previous attempts at cultivating human
cells all resulted in the cells dying after a few cell divisions. A scientist
named George Gey began a cell line from the extracted tumour cells that was the
first [immortal cell line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortalised_cell_line)
ever produced, and was known simply as
[HeLa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa). The cells have been used by
scientists ever since due to their ease of use in testing, and were involved in
experiments that have revolutionised modern medicine, including cloning,
genetic mapping, and the development of the polio vaccine.

Rebecca Skloot, author of the book [The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Immortal_Life_of_Henrietta_Lacks),
recently [published an article in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/opinion/sunday/the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks-the-sequel.html)
after a team of European scientists published the genome sequence of the HeLa
cells without the consent of the Lacks family.

The story of the HeLa cell line is a fascinating one, and I remember that the
virology podcast [This Week In Virology](http://www.twiv.tv/) had an episode a
while back where they interviewed Philip Marcus, who was the first person to
clone HeLa cells. The episode and interview are embedded below, and are well
worth a listen.

As well as the links included above, Skloot's post prompted some interesting
discussion on ethics and privacy of the genome which makes for interesting
reading. I would recommend taking a look at the posts below:
