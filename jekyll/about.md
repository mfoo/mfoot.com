Hello, my name is Martin Foot. I'm a software engineer working in a small
financial services company in London. I enjoy solving difficult problems and
experimenting with new technologies. In my spare time I enjoy reading books,
watching films, and experimenting with photography and historical photographic
processes. I develop my own film, use my enlargers to make silver gelatin prints
of the negatives, and enjoy experimenting with some of the simpler historical
processes such as the [Cyanotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanotype)
process and the [Salt Print](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_print) process.
I am looking forward to trying out new processes once I have the equipment and
knowledge, and have a particular interest in the [Wet Plate
Collodion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collodion_process) process.
