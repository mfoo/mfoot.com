I came across a presentation from [Drew Neil](http://drewneil.com/) of
[Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/) fame, all about what makes Vim the editor that
it is. I've seen several of the Vimcasts videos and always learn something new,
but this presentation gives a nice overview of the history of Vim and why some
of the features of the modal text editor evolved. Worth a watch (49 minutes).
