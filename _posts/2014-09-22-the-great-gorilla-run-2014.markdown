The 21st of October 2014 saw the [Great Gorilla Run](http://greatgorillarun.org/)
in central London. Set over an 8km route, contestants dress up as gorillas to
raise money for charity.

I took my Nikon FM2N loaded with Rollei RPX 400 film and went with some friends
to watch the event. It was fun to see all the modifications to the costumes
that people made. The images below show the event as I saw it. They were
developed in Rodinal R09 for 8 minutes at 20 degrees celcius.

Contestants congregate at Mincing Lane for the staging ground. Here a fairy, a
cheerleader, and a Hawaiian gorilla wait for the start:

Everybody starts to make their way towards the starting line:

This chap was in high spirits:

Even a storm trooper gorilla turned up. This one brought his family:

For people who were unaware that a race was happening, having a hundred
gorillas run past must be a surreal experience.

At the half way mark, spirits were still high. Running in the suits must be
incredibly uncomfortable!

Bill Oddie and Uri Geller hand out medals to all of the contestants at the
finish line:
