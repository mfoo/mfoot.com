A friend recently told me about these MP3 recordings of the original BBC Radio
broadcast of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy by the late Douglas Adams.
They're well worth a listen, and you can download the set
[here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/collections.shtml).

You can find a lot more BBC archive footage and audio clips at the [BBC
Collections Archive](http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/collections.shtml).
