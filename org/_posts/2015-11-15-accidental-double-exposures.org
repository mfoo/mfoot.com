Multiple exposure images are a lot of fun to make and it's always exciting to see the final output. On film cameras they
can be deliberate or accidental. They could be caused by careful planning, lack of thought before acting, or mechanical
failure. In the case of these two produced with my Nikon FM2N I had no intention of taking photos like this at all, yet
they're some of my most memorable photos from trips last year

The first photo is in Athens near Monastiraki, not far from the Acropolis. Two separate night time shots of city streets
combined to make something that doesn't quite represent either:

The second shot is from the Fushimi Inara Shrine near Kyoto, Japan. The shrine itself is stunningly beautiful and I was
lucky enough to visit on a lovely sunny day when the cherry blossoms were blooming. I think this was caused by me
accidentally tripping the multiple exposure latch on the Nikon.

I love getting shots like this back from the lab. It's usually very difficult to tell from the negative what is going on
so you must wait for the scan to see the full awesomeness of such happy accidents. There also are some very creative
people out there making full use of the medium of multiple exposure, deliberately composing and shooting scenes for a
desired effect. I highly recommend having a search around on Google Images and Flickr for some more examples, and I
suggest you start [[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/multiple-exposures/][here]].
