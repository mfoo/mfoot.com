In my attempt to keep my ear to the floor with the happenings in the game industry I have collected a bunch of interesting blogs into a Google Reader shared collection. These feeds are gathered from several places including manual searching and several really [useful posts](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/3223/game-development-blogs) on the subject. Including game art, design,  theory, planning/management/publishing, and coding, there's a lot of brilliant information here!

So, if anybody is interested:
