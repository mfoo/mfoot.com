Through the run-up to Christmas 2011, the Mozilla Developer Network has been posting a link a day in their [MDN Holiday Calendar](http://thewebrocks.com/calendar/). This post serves as a collection of those posts as a time-saver, but the site is worth checking out. Note that none of this is my work, the calendar was written by Chris Heilmann with additional links provided by Luke Crouch, Robert Nyman and Rob Hawkes. Source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/codepo8/calendar-tutorial) and there is a making of tutorial: [Part 1](http://christianheilmann.com/2011/11/29/building-an-advent-calendar-for-mozilla-in-phpjscss-part-1/) - [Part 2.](http://christianheilmann.com/2011/11/29/building-an-advent-calendar-for-mozilla-in-phpjscss-part-2/)

Also note: this isn't an error, at the time of writing numbers 2 and 10 point to the same URL. Number 10 also seems to have a broken quote with half missing! Despite this, some of these articles are really interesting!
