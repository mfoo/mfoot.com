Each year in Battersea Park, London, there is a charity event called the
[Sumo Run](http://www.sumorun.com/). It's a lot of fun and a great opportunity
to take some pictures.

Below is a set of images from the Sumo Run 2013 that have been lying around on
my hard drive for a while. They were all taken with a Minolta Dynax SPxi and a
Sigma 70-210mm f4-5.6 lens. The colour photos are Lomography colour negative
400 film and the black and white photos are Ilford FP4.
