  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks have gone since my last roundup, I have moved house and started working at a new job so haven&#8217;t had much time. That said, here&#8217;s a list of articles that I&#8217;ve found interesting over the past week. I&#8217;ve been getting into the &#8216;devops&#8217; world recently (or at least using some of the domain tools and learning about scalable infrastructures), so many of the links are related.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Above is a video from HackADay about a new robot called the Sand Flea that <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/03/31/sand-flea-literally-leaps-tall-buildings-in-a-single-bound/">has an impressive ability to jump over obstacles</a>. This could be very useful for robotic exploration in areas of difficult terrain.</p></li>
<li><p>A scientist has taken over 90,000 hours of video of his baby son via cameras all around the house in order to try and understand the learning of language and how we pick up and reproduce new words. I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;ve seen a video of this before a few years ago, but now there is a lot more footage and similarly more interesting results. Read more about it including several videos <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1733627/mit-scientist-captures-his-sons-first-90000-hours-on-video">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/3/30/ann-rails-3-2-3-has-been-released/">new version of Rails</a> has been released, which among other things addresses the <em>config.active_record.whitelist_attributes</em> issue that lead to the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1069-responsible-disclosure-policy">GitHub compromise</a> earlier this year.</p></li>
<li><p>Ranjib Dey has an <a href="http://ranjib.posterous.com/infrastructure-tooling-patterns">overview of the main common parts in web infrastructures</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Nikolay Sturm describes how we can <a href="http://blog.nistu.de/2012/03/04/reusability-in-configuration-management-systems/">apply object oriented principles such as the single responsibility principle and object extendability to configuration management systems</a> such as <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Nikolay was also featured on the <a href="http://www.foodfightshow.org/2012/03/episode-6-cookbook-reusability-with.html">Food Fight podcast talking about Cookbook reusability with Chef</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a> have <a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/">a blog post </a>describing how their infrastructure can scale and pump out new VMs so that newly hired employees can push something to production on their first day. It&#8217;s interesting seeing which tools they use and how they use them to facilitate this.</p></li>
<li><p>Netflix maintain a technical blog that describes some of the challenges they face and how they go about overcoming them. One in particular talks about <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/fault-tolerance-in-high-volume.html">fault tolerance in high volume distributed systems</a> and is a useful read for anybody designing a service based architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>John Vincent discusses requirements to be able to <a href="http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2012/03/06/graphs-in-operations/">accurately graph dependencies at macro and micro levels</a> in order to efficiently act upon changes in the dependency hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, in a less educational but more entertaining capacity, I have been reading several articles each trying to clarify what DevOps really is and if/why it&#8217;s actually useful. Make what you will of the content. <a href="http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2012/03/13/what-is-devops-not/">What DevOps is not</a>, <a href="http://perfcap.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html">Ops, DevOps and PaaS (NoOps) at Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/2140086">a response to that post</a>.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959">The Mythical Man Month by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.</a>, and I came across several paragraphs that brilliantly and elegantly capture the joy of programming and the reward of solving a problem in five different points. The following is a copy of page 7 of the anniversary edition. I would definitely recommend this book to any career programmer.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as a reward?</p></blockquote>

<p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God&#8217;s delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and snowflake.</p>

<p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child&#8217;s first clay pencil holder &#8220;for Daddy&#8217;s office.&#8221;</p>

<p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer has all the fascination of a pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>

<p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or other the problem is never new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the delight in working with such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from the air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.</p>

<p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet&#8217;s words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sound, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>

<p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
