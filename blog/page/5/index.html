  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to start taking notes of a few interesting articles/websites that I find each week in order to share them with others and preserve them for myself. And so begins Week One. Links will cover any article that I find interesting, but will largely be grounded in science and technology.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/03/02/stunning-time-lapse-video-the-light-of-stars/">awesome <strong>time-lapse video of night skies</strong></a> was posted the other day (embedded above). I love stunning videos of nature and this is no exception.</p></li>
<li><p>Some scientists as part of a Russian research team have <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/02/120221-oldest-seeds-regenerated-plants-science/?source=link-tw20120229news-plant">reportedly managed to <strong>germinate seeds that were found under 124 feet (38 meters) of permafrost</strong></a> (annoyingly, it doesn&#8217;t link to the source journal article), which were determined to be around 32,000 years old by radiocarbon dating. The article describes how knowledge of unfreezing and re-cultivating these seeds could benefit places such as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/collusion/">experimental plugin for Firefox</a> called Collision that allows you to <strong>visualise the connections between services that websites use to track you while you are online</strong>. It&#8217;s certainly quite eye-opening about the number of websites that record your usage data and statistics. Mozilla writes: <em>Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience. But most tracking happens without users&#8217; consent and without their knowledge. That’s not okay. It should be you who decides when, how and if you want to be tracked. Collusion will be a powerful tool to help you do that</em></p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi foundation</a> also recently announced that they have <strong>started shipping A and B model Raspberry Pis</strong>, although they are currently out of stock in both RS and Farnell. Using these distributors allows for a much higher production rate that scales to demand, and will help reduce shipping costs for people due to worldwide distribution networks. Can&#8217;t wait until they are back in stock.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/03/02/tongue-parasites-to-people-of-earth-thank-you-for-your-overfishing/">scary post that describes </a><strong><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/03/02/tongue-parasites-to-people-of-earth-thank-you-for-your-overfishing/">a fish parasite</a> that enters the gills of a fish, devours its tongue, then positions itself in place of the tongue</strong>. Just the picture alone is creepy! Nature is awesome.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01cywtq/Horizon_20112012_The_Truth_About_Exercise/">BBC Horizon show</a> about <strong>what exercise really does and the best ways of getting the maximum benefit</strong> (probably UK only). This is coupled with <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2012/03/02/just-3-days-of-lazing-around-will-weaken-your-ability-to-regulate-blood-sugar/">a post from DiscoverMagazine</a> on a new study that suggests <strong>healthy people will develop higher blood sugar after only three days of a sedentary lifestyle</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/939">post from Mark Shuttleworth</a> that shows the <strong>new HUD functionality coming in Ubuntu 12.04</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>A good collection of <a href="http://www.dextronet.com/micro-isv-insights/2012/01/30-books-everyone-in-software-business-should-read-and-why/"><strong>30 books that everyone in the software business should read and why</strong></a>. I know that five or six of these are already on my Amazon wishlist for when I have the time, and it&#8217;s definitely a list worth looking at.</p></li>
<li><p>An <a href="lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2010-December/074114.html">interesting explanation of <strong>why the bin, sbin, usr/bin, and usr/sbin folders exist</strong> in Unix</a> as well as why the programs located in each exist where they do.</p></li>
<li><p>A <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/2/13/tumblr-architecture-15-billion-page-views-a-month-and-harder.html">detailed and very interesting article describing Tumblr&#8217;s scalable architecture</a> and how it allows them to serve &#8216;500 million page views a day, a peak rate of ~40k requests per second, ~3TB of new data to store a day, all running on 1000+ servers&#8217;.</p></li>

<time datetime="2012-01-23T15:35:28+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 23<span>rd</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have recently been looking for a C++ maths library for use in game development projects. There are plenty of posts on websites like <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/">gamedev.stackexchange.com</a> with suggestions for libraries but few quantitative comparisons between them. I decided to take three of the most popular libraries and run some tests of my own. Below I describe the three libraries I&#8217;ve compared with their advantages and disadvantages and then show the results of some performance tests. It&#8217;s important for me to have cross-platform compatibility, so each library selected is header only and has been tested on Mac, Linux, and Android using the NDK. The code and results are also available <a href="https://github.com/mfoo/Math-Library-Test">on GitHub</a> for testing.</p>

<p>The libraries tested are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/">Eigen</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://glm.g-truc.net/">GLM</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://cmldev.net/">CML</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>These choices are largely influenced by reading their websites and posts at the <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/">Game Development StackExchange</a> site:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/9924/best-c-math-library-for-game-engine">Best C Math Library for Game Engine?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5935075/high-performance-math-library-for-vector-and-matrix-calculations">High Performance Math Library for Vector And Matrix Calculations</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/8234/complete-math-library-for-use-in-opengl-es-2-0-game">Complete Math Library for use in OpenGL ES 2.0 Game?</a></p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>I have several requirements for a math library, and when rating them (in no particular order) the <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/21711/what-should-be-taken-into-consideration-when-choosing-a-math-library-for-games">following things are important</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>License</p></li>
<li><p>Portability</p></li>
<li><p>Quality and quantity of the documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Completeness (or how much can the library do without me having to write my own functions). For game development this includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Matrix operations</p></li>
<li><p>Vector operations</p></li>
<li><p>Complex number support</p></li>
<li><p>Quaternion operations</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Extensibility and community contributions (linked directly to the above).</p></li>
<li><p>Ease of use (are the concepts simple to understand?)</p></li>
<li><p>Performance (are there SIMD optimisations?)</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Libraries Overview</h1>

<h2>Configurable Math Library (CML)</h2>

<p>This is a free library designed for games, graphics, and computational geometry applications. Listed <a href="http://cmldev.net/?page_id=8">features</a> include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Vector, matrix, and quarternion classes</p></li>
<li><p>Templated headers so can be used for arbitrary types</p></li>
<li><p>Arbitrary sized vectors and matrices (fixed or dynamically resizable)</p></li>
<li><p>Conversions between polar, cylindrical, spherical, and Cartesian coordinates</p></li>
<li><p>A large library of functions for the construction and manipulation of transforms in 2D and 3D</p></li>
</ul>


<p>CML&#8217;s <a href="http://cmldev.net/?page_id=594">design notes</a> state that it is meant to be cross-platform and portable and therefore doesn&#8217;t contain any platform specific optimisations, but it is possible to include them in the future if there is specific interest.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only one header file to include, <code>cml/cml.h</code>.</p>

<p>CML contains quite a nice way of creating an abstraction layer between existing math library objects and CML objects, allowing the use of other math library data types in CML library functions. See <a href="http://cmldev.net/?p=424">here</a>.</p>

<p>CML only has a few <a href="http://cmldev.net/?p=402">examples</a>. Hasn&#8217;t been updated in a while. Contains useful functions for working with OpenGL or DirectX though, including replacements for things like gluLookAt().</p>

<p>CML is released under the <a href="http://cmldev.net/?p=430">Boost Software License</a>. This means that you&#8217;re allowed to use and profit from the library as long as when distributing CML or any modifications you have made to CML, you keep the Boost Software License text in each file.</p>

<h2>Eigen</h2>

<p>This library has by far the most detailed and descriptive tutorial section with many code samples. It is also worth noting that it seems to be the most frequently updated and the most up-to-date (at the time of writing the most recent release, 3.0.4, was 3.5 weeks ago).</p>

<p>Like GLM, it is very easy to pass the class objects directly to OpenGL, although in Eigen this is performed by an <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox-devel/unsupported/group__OpenGLSUpport__Module.html">unsupported OpenGL module</a> which provides a few functions such as glTranslate and glRotate.</p>

<pre><code>// You need to add path_to_eigen/unsupported to your include path.
#include &lt;Eigen/OpenGLSupport&gt;
// ...
Vector3f x, y;
Matrix3f rot;
glVertex(y + x * rot);

Quaternion q;
glRotate(q);
</code></pre>

<p>Provides a large number of array, matrix, and vector types with <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/QuickRefPage.html#QuickRef_Types">many operators</a>.</p>

<p>Eigen is licensed under the LGPL which is quite restrictive and usually would exclude a library based on my requirements. However, Eigen has a large <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Licensing_FAQ">Licensing FAQ</a> which tries to answer any licensing questions people might have. Their main point is that as Eigen is a header only library, it does not count as a &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; under the LGPL it can be therefore used entirely under Section 3. This states that to use Eigen you must:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. The Eigen FAQ states that &#8216;the bottom of a README file or of a website would be prominent enough for us&#8217;.</p></li>
<li><p>Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This assumes that you&#8217;re using Eigen unmodified. If you are planning to make changes to Eigen and release it, then you must also make the modifications available under the LGPL.</p>

<h2>OpenGL Math Library (GLM)</h2>

<p>GLM&#8217;s main design to be very familiar to those who know GLSL as it uses classes and functions that use the GLSL naming conventions. It also seems to provide all of the functionality that I might need in the future.</p>

<p>Includes several code samples, more than CML. Many more located in the manual.</p>

<p>Includes features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Math for splines</p></li>
<li><p>Math for colour spaces</p></li>
<li><p>Random numbers</p></li>
<li><p>Simplex noise generation</p></li>
<li><p>Conversion of Euler angles</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There&#8217;s only one header file to include, <code>glm/glm.hpp</code>. <code>glm/ext.hpp</code> can be included to add extended features (non GLSL features).</p>

<p>The design choice to follow GLSL conventions allows the library to be intuitive and easy to use, especially given that data alignment is compatible with gl functions. E.g:</p>

<pre><code>glm::vec4 v(0);
glm::mat4 m(0);
glVertex3fv(glm::value_ptr(v));
glLoadMatrixfv(glm::value_ptr(m));
</code></pre>

<p>The manual pdf file link is broken but a slightly out of date version can be found <a href="https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gltut/src/6332c7f79903/glm-0.9.0.0/doc/glm-manual.pdf">here</a>. I&#8217;ve sent the maintainer an email and hopefully this will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>GLM is licensed under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a> (Expat License) which is very permissive and means GLM is a good candidate for any project requiring a math library.</p>

<p>To run the tests on Android you will need the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html">Android NDK</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-cmake/">android-cmake</a>. For Ant you will need to specify your Android SDK location in <code>android/local.properties</code>. I have included prebuilt libraries for armeabi and armeabi-v7a so if you don&#8217;t want to compile them yourself you can skip straight to the ant commants.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>

<p>So far I&#8217;ve tested matrix addition and multiplication. <code>src/Main.cpp</code> contains code that will generate two lists of 1 million 4x4 float matrices for each library, populate them with random float values, and then add each one from the first column to the second. It will then do the same for multiplication. It will repeat this step 10 times and print out how long it took for each library.</p>

<p>Results for each library vary greatly with architecture and optimisation level. I have tested standard GCC build on Mac OS X Lion as well as an SSE enabled build, and armeabi, armeabi-v7a and armeabi-v7a with NEON instructions for Android.</p>

<p>Note that all tests use the <code>-O2</code> GCC optimisation flag except the non-SSE laptop build which uses <code>-O0</code>.</p>

<p>Results for addition and multiplication are shown below. Note that the laptop I&#8217;m using is an i7 2.2ghz early 2011 MacBook Pro and the Android device is a Stock HTC Desire (2.2) with a 1 GHz Qualcomm QSD8250. All times are in milliseconds.</p>

<pre><code>                        laptop  laptop (SSE)  armeabi  armeabi-v7a  armeabi-v7a with neon
Eigen additions         8065    30            9944     2181         2145
Eigen multiplications   22404   86            59460    5143         5113
GLM additions           2375    76            10256    1506         1407
GLM multiplications     7337    400           59008    2189         3108
CML additions           12336   96            9587     2885         2996
CML multiplications     21603   551           58399    5306         5280
</code></pre>

<p>The first column for the laptop doesn&#8217;t have any compile-time optimisations and is included purely for interest. From the other results, Eigen seems to be the fastest for these operations, but GLM is the fastest on the HTC Desire with both ABIs. I am not sure why the NEON times are not much faster (and in some cases, slower) but will update this post when I learn more.</p>

<p>Despite GLM being faster on the mobile devices, I am more inclined to use Eigen due to its speed on the tested Intel CPU and its much better documentation and more active community.</p>
